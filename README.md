# CplusplusProject
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - The goal of this project was to create a program that could read text records from an input file, analyze the information, and then store the data in a different file for a hypothetical company.
2. What did you do particularly well?
  - I liked implementing OOP, especially using a map as the classes' main member variable which was unforeseen territory at the time. Implementing that allowed me to minimize the quantity of code I wrote.
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  - I could improve the functionality of the code by allowing the input file to take in any user inputted file name but for the purposes of the project, I left it static. As for making the code more efficient or closer to optimal best practices, there is a lot I can improve on and probably things I am not even aware of.
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - I still struggle with the input stream. After testing the code over and over again, I was left using "cin.clear();cin.ignore(123, '\n');" to get the code working. There are several resources that help but I find the visual help of youtube and Stackoverflow to be awesome.
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  - Being able to solve problems with general guidlines and without help is a big step forward. It challenged my imagination and creativity which will help me in the future. Also, exploring different data structures like I did with the map will become increasingly important.
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - I tried to follow best practices by implemnting OOP, using a header file, keeping the main function as clean as possible.
